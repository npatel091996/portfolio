##Work Experience
Lab Information System Analyst Intern @ Atlantic Health System 
•	Developed SQL/Crystal reports, automating data retrieval and analysis, reducing report generation time, and facilitating real-time decision-making.
•	Executed patient merges in Power-path reducing data redundancy by approximately 10%.

## Projects
Heart Disease Mortality Rates in the USA–Trends and Insights using Tableau:
•	Heart Disease Mortality Datasets extracted from CDC archives were used to create a dashboard in Tableau to visualize trends in heart disease mortality by State, Gender, and Race.

Predictive Modeling of Synthetic Gene Splicing:
•	Utilized R to develop a multiple linear regression model for predicting gene-splicing patterns, trained on 70% of the synthetic dataset, and the remaining 30% was used to optimize its performance, demonstrating proficiency in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and model integration.

Inferential Statistics and Data Analysis of Drug Trial Datasets using SAS:
•	The datasets were cleaned, validated, and merged using SAS Data Cleaning procedures. Descriptive analysis and visualization were conducted for data comprehension. A 1000-datapoint random sample was obtained, normality and sample size were checked, and ANOVA was run using PROC GLM to find out if symptom reduction by the drug was statistically significant or not.
